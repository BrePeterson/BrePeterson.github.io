    <h2>C'mon Man</h2>
    <p>When I think of something that makes me laugh I think of the ESPN series "C'mon Man" that show clips from football games that you cant help but laugh and say "C'mon Man". Here is an example.</p>

    <h2>A Laugh Now...not then</h2>
    <p>If I ever need a good laugh I pull up a video that I was in about concussions. I find it funny now to watch the video becuase it shows me at the ripe age of 12, my style, what I said, and the fact that my name is spelled wrong...just makes me laugh. At the time however it wasn't really a joking matter. Check out the video.</p>
