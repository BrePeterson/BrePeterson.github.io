        		Jackie Robinson was the first African American baseball player in the MLB, and he is a hero to me for these reasons:
    		</h2>
    		<ul>
        		<li>Stood up for his own beliefs</li>
        		<li>Never gave up until he got what he wanted</li>
        		<li>Paved the way for many other baseball players</li>
        		<li>Was not willing to let other people's words change his plan</li>
        		<li>Always acted with integrity</li>
    		</ul>

		        What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.
    		</p>
    		<p>
        		No man exemplifies these values for me more than Jackie Robinson. He was a man who went through so many agonizng events but never gave up. He was called racist slurs but never gave in. He was there to play baseball and never cared about anything other than making it fair and equal for everyone. And he did just that, and to me that is why he is my hero!
